# You are given an image represented by an m x n grid of integers image, where image[i][j] represents the pixel value of the image. You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. Your task is to perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].

# To perform a flood fill:

# Begin with the starting pixel and change its color to color.
# Perform the same process for each pixel that is directly adjacent (pixels that share a side with the original pixel, either horizontally or vertically) and shares the same color as the starting pixel.
# Keep repeating this process by checking neighboring pixels of the updated pixels and modifying their color if it matches the original color of the starting pixel.
# The process stops when there are no more adjacent pixels of the original color to update.
# Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2

# Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]

# Explanation:



# From the center of the image with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1) (i.e., the red pixel), all pixels connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel (i.e., the blue pixels) are colored with the new color.

# Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not horizontally or vertically connected to the starting pixel.

# Example 2:

# Input: image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], sr = 0, sc = 0, color = 0

# Output: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]

# Explanation:

# The starting pixel is already colored with 0, which is the same as the target color. Therefore, no changes are made to the image.

class Solution:
    def floodFill(self, image: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, color: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        starting_pixel = image[sr][sc]
        self.dfs(image,sr,sc,color,starting_pixel)

        return image

    def dfs(self,image, sr , sc, color, starting_pixel):
        if sr<0 or sr> len(image)-1 or sc<0 or sc > len(image[0])-1 or image[sr][sc] == color or image[sr][sc]!= starting_pixel:
                return 

        image[sr][sc] = color
        self.dfs(image,sr+1,sc,color,starting_pixel)
        self.dfs(image,sr-1,sc,color,starting_pixel)
        self.dfs(image,sr,sc+1,color,starting_pixel)
        self.dfs(image,sr,sc-1,color,starting_pixel)
